👋 Hi, I’m @IvanDrop9
<br>
👀 I’m interested in web development, particularly in Vue.js and other modern JavaScript frameworks.
<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced state management in Vue.js, including Vuex and Pinia.
<br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to front-end development, UI/UX design, and building reusable components.
<br>
⚡ Fun fact: I’m an avid hiker and have climbed the highest peaks in three different continents!
